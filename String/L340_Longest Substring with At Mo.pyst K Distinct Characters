Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, Given s = “eceba” and k = 2,

T is "ece" which its length is 3.



class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s, k):
        longest, start, distinct_count, visited = 0, 0, 0, [0 for _ in xrange(256)]
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if visited[ord(char)] == 0:
                distinct_count += 1
            visited[ord(char)] += 1
             
            while distinct_count > k:
                visited[ord(s[start])] -= 1
                if visited[ord(s[start])] == 0:
                    distinct_count -= 1
                start += 1
   
            longest = max(longest, i - start + 1)
        return longest
