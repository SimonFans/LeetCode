Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.

Example 1:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.
Example 2:
Input:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

class Solution:
    def findPairs(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if k>0:
            return len(set(nums) & set(k+n for n in nums))
        # when k==0: count the # of occurence for each number in a dict{}
        if k==0:
            return sum(i>1 for i in collections.Counter(nums).values())
        if k<0:
            return 0
