Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0

        # Sorted Array 想二分法 time complexity: logn, space complexity: O(1)
        # Binary search runs in at worst logarithmic time, making O(log n) comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array, the O is Big O notation, and log is the logarithm. Binary search takes constant (O(1)) space, meaning that the space taken by the algorithm is the same for any number of elements in the array.
        l=0
        r=len(nums)-1
        while l<=r:
            mid=l+(r-l)//2
            if nums[mid]==target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid]<target:
                l=mid+1
            else:
                r=mid-1
        return l
