Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.


# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :rtype: List[Interval]
        """
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)
        merged=[]
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1].end<interval.start:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1].end=max(interval.end,merged[-1].end)
        return merged
