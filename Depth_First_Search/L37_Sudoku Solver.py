Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.


A sudoku puzzle...


...and its solution numbers marked in red.

Note:

The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
The given board size is always 9x9.
